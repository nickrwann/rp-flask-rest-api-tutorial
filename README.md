# Flask REST API Tutorial

## Project Overview

Hello there! Welcome to my repository where I'll be following a fantastic tutorial from "Real Python" to expand my skillset in Flask, REST API development, and JavaScript. In this tutorial, I'll be building a Flask REST API, enhancing it with several endpoints, and connecting it to a database.

The tutorial consists of three parts:

- Part 1: Building a REST API
- Part 2: Connecting the REST API to a Database
- Part 3: Adding Relationships to the REST API and Database

## Part 1: Building the REST API

In the first part of the tutorial, I'll focus on building a robust REST API. I'll start by setting up the Flask project and ensuring that the API connects to the database. This part will give me a good understanding of the app's back-end structure and functionality.

## Part 2: Connecting to a Database

Once I have my REST API up and running, I'll move on to the second part of the tutorial. Here, I'll connect my API to a database, replacing the in-memory storage with a proper data storage solution. This will provide a more reliable and scalable approach to data management.

## Part 3: Adding Relationships and Enhancements

In the final part of the tutorial, I'll take my REST API to the next level. I'll introduce relationships between different entities in my API and make additional enhancements to improve its functionality and performance.

Throughout the project, I'll be working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to develop a single-page web application. Step by step, I'll improve the application's maintainability and appearance.

By the end of the tutorial, I'll have a solid understanding of creating a Flask REST API and communicating with it from a JavaScript-powered front end.
